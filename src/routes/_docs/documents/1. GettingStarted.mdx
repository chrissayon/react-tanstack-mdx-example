# Creating a document file

## MDX Files

MDX files are a subset of a markdown (\*.md) that allow you to use JSX syntax inside your markdown files.

The folder directory for this is located in:

```
src/routes/_docs/documents
```

## Creating a file

To get started with creating a document, create a (\*.mdx) file in the directory.
Make sure that the file exports the following at beginning of the file:

```tsx
export const meta = {
  title: "Getting Started",
  path: "GettingStarted",
};
```

The `title` will be name that's used in the sidebar.

The `file` will be the URL that is used when loading the page.

## Ordering the document (left) sidebar

The order of the files in the sidebar is the same as the order the files in the folder.

Hence, it's best you begin the files with numbers to order.

## Title highlight on (right) sidebar

There's an intersection observer component that looks at all `h2` elements on the page
and displays them all on the sidebar.

The sidebar will highlight the last h2 element that's displayed on the page.
